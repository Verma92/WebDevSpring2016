Deep straw to light amber in color with a thick, pure white head. The saison yeast strain gives off fruity aromas of pear, apple and slight citrus balanced with a delicate floral hop character and a touch of spiciness. Taste is very clean, with pronounced fruit flavors, delicate bready malt followed by welcomed spicing. Crisp finish with lingering yet subtle notes of yeast and touches of fruity pepper. \nOmmegang Shadow Brewer \nImperial Stout - 9.7%\nWhere the moonlight casts shadows and doubt toil a brewer, unleashing impassioned intentions in the form of an audacious stout. He finds freedom in his nocturnal efforts. He finds room under cover of night to seek flavors more darkly imagined roasted chocolate, with bitter black bite. Our Shadow Brewer pours black as night under a thick tan head. There, roasted malt, coffee and chocolate tastes and aromas give in to creamy notes, dark fruit, and pleasing bitterness. \nSeven Kingdoms \nAmerican Wheat or Rye Beer - 6.9%\nSeven Kingdoms is a marriage of a traditional Belgian-style wheat and a hop-forward American ale -- but unlike so many of the marriages on the show, the resulting hoppy wheat is pleasant, playful and inspired. At 6.9% ABV, it possesses a nuanced complexity that pairs nicely with the hop-forward characteristics that make it surprisingly refreshing. \nMc Chouffe \nBelgian Dark Strong Ale - 8%\nThe Mc Chouffe is an unfiltered dark beer, which is re-fermented in the bottle as well as in the keg. Behind its fruity flavor a slight hint of bitterness may be found. \n  ", "html": "<P>Join us at the release party for the new Ommegang Game of Thrones Seven Kingdoms Hoppy Wheat Beer on Wednesday, 03/30 at PJ Ryans in Somerville!

Roasted malt \"charred\" flavors mix beautifully with a sweetness from the tequila barrels.\u00a0At 9.5% this one is boozy!\u00a0\n\n\nSun Juice\u00a0is a tasty Belgian Summer Ale that's brewed with\u00a0wheat and Saison yeast. It's also got a bit of orange peel, grapefruit peel,\u00a0coriander\u00a0and chamomile, reminding you that summer is coming!\n\n\nThe\u00a0Stony Joe\u00a0is a unique blend of styles. A\u00a0golden mocha stout,\u00a0it is\u00a0Brewed like a milk stout but instead of dark malts they use\u00a0English barley giving it a golden color.

So RSVP and we'll see you there!\u00a0 \n \nSun Juice \nSaison - 5.3%\nSun Juice is a refreshing Belgian Summer Ale brewed with wheat. Saison yeast produces a silky body while orange peel, grapefruit peel, corriander , and chamomile impart a spicy and fruity complexity. It's summertime, grab youirself some Sun Juice. \nChahklit Baltic Porter \nBaltic Porter - 8.5%\nGrandma Clara makes Chahklit Tea for her family. She uses hand ground cacao pods, cinnamon leaf, almond, milk, and maybe the occasionaL splash of rum...for your health. This is our tribute to her Jamaican tradition. Chahklit is a Baltic Porter brewed with almonds and earthy Ceylon Cinnamon. Cacao Nibs impart rich chocolate depth. IT ages in Caribbean Rum Barrels to lend oak complexity and subtle Rum nuance. Sip it slowly and be transported back to Grandma Clara's kitchen. \nReposado Negro \nAmerican Barleywine - 9.2%\nReposado Tequila is known for its oak aged, smooth complexity. This is our interpretation of the fine Mexican spirit. Reposado Negro is A Black Wheat Wine aged in Tequila Barrels. A marriage of sweet alcohol warmth, smooth bready texture, and roasted malt \"charred\" flavors, this jet black brew will have you swearing you are sipping a top shelf tequila. \nBig Cranky Double IPA \nImperial IPA - 9.5%\nA Bold West Coast Double IPA, this is the crankiest of our IPAs. 7 different hops contribute complex and juicy hop character. Its dry finish allows the hops to stand out. At 9.5% ABV and 95 IBUs, while remarkably cranky, this beer is extraordinarily drinkable. \nPetite Cranky \nIndia Pale Ale (IPA)\nThis is an anniversary beer by stony creek. A session IPA with Saison yeast! \nStony Joe \nStout - 5.5%\nStony Joe is a Golden Mocha Stout. It is designed like a traditional Milk Stout but without using the typical roasted dark malts. Instead we use a boat load of rich, decadent golden colored English barley, flaked barley, flaked oats, and flaked wheat to give it lush body and smooth sweetness. We then ferment it on Cocoa Nibs and add fresh locally roasted Guatemalan Coffee, directly to the fermenter. The cocoa nibs and coffee add the rich mocha notes and bright roasty/coffee aroma! \nSnow Hole Imperial Red \nImperial IPA - 8.5% 85 IBUs\nA Snowhole is someone who loves a brutal winter. Our Double Red, with its malty notes of caramel and dark sugar, is complemented perfectly by intense citrus and spicy hops. 6 different hops, 8 hop additions, over 3.5 pounds of hops per barrel, 8.5% ABV and 85 IBUs make for a winter brew that can stand up to any storm. \nBlack Water Pils \nPilsner\nThis is a brand new Black Pilsner from Stoney Creek!
